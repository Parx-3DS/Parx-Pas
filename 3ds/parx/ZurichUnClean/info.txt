Clitoridectomy: sometimes referred to as excision, which involves the removal of the entire clitoris, rather than just the tip, and the labia minora; the inside lips of the vagina. The opening is left open, rather than sewn together, as in the case of infibulation.

Infibulation: the entire clitoris is removed, as well as the inner and outer labia (minora and majora), scraping of the sides of the vulva and then joining them together and sewing them up with thread or catgut, or sometimes closing them with thorns. A small opening is left in order that urine and menstrual blood may pass through. A woman who has been infibulated must be cut open to allow sexual intercourse and childbirth, and then is re-sewn to ensure faithfulness to her husband.
